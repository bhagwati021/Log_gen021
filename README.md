# Web Scraping, Logging, and Data Processing Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a modular project designed for:

- Web Scraping: Extracting data from websites efficiently.

- Log Generation: Tracking and recording activity logs for monitoring and debugging.

- Data Processing: Cleaning, transforming, and analyzing the scraped data.

Each component runs independently, allowing users to utilize only the functionality they need without dependencies on other modules.

## Features
### 1)Log Generator
- Log Generation:Generates random log entries with timestamps, log levels, actions, and users.
- Writes specified number of logs to a file.
  
### 2)Web Scraping
- Extracts data from multiple websites.
- Implements robust error handling and retry mechanisms.
- Supports scraping data in various formats (HTML, JSON, XML).

### 3)Data Processing
- Log Generation:Generates random log entries with timestamps, log levels, actions, and users. Writes specified number of logs to a file.
- Log Processing:Reads and processes logs, cleaning and parsing timestamps. Handles invalid or missing data.
- Data Analysis:Analyzes log levels, actions, and user activity.
- Computes metrics: total logs, unique users, average logs/day, and max logs/day.
- Visualization:Plots log frequency trends over time with Matplotlib.

## Usage

### (1) Web Scraping

Replace the URL in the script with your target URL: ` url='https://www.python.org/downloads/' `

Run the script to scrape and save data: ` python WebScraper.py `

The output is saved in ` scraped_data.json `

### (2) Log Generator
Generate logs by specifying the output file and number of entries:` python Log_Generator.py `

This will create a file ` generated_logs.txt ` with 200 log entries.

### (3) Data Processing
Analyze the processed logs: ` python Data_processing.py `

Outputs statistical summaries and visualizes trends
